abstract = {The complexities of various search algorithms are considered in terms of time, space, and cost of solution path. It is known that breadth-first search requires too much space and depth-first search can use too much time and doesn't always find a cheapest path. A depth-first iterative-deepening algorithm is shown to be asymptotically optimal along all three dimensions for exponential tree searches. The algorithm has been used successfully in chess programs, has been effectively combined with bi-directional search, and has been applied to best-first heuristic search as well. This heuristic depth-first iterative-deepening algorithm is the only known algorithm that is capable of finding optimal solutions to randomly generated instances of the Fifteen Puzzle within practical resource limits.}

abstract = {This paper describes the results of applying the formal heurisitic search algorithm
to the game of chess, and the impact of this work on the theory of heuristic search.
It is not that the application of the heuristic search can by itself solve the problems
at the heart of the computer chess, but that representing these problems within the
formalism of the heuristic search will further their common solution. A separate search
heuristic is proposed that does offer a common solution to the problems of quiescence,
sacrifices, and plan oriented play.},
